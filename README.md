# LSTM-Based Text Generation Model

This project demonstrates the use of a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model for generating text sequences. The model is built using Keras and trained on a large dataset to predict the next word in a given sequence. The purpose is to generate coherent and contextually relevant text based on an input seed.

## Key Features:
- **Model Architecture**: The LSTM model includes an embedding layer, multiple LSTM layers, and dense layers.
- **Techniques Used**:
  - Tokenization of input text for preprocessing.
  - Regularization to prevent overfitting.
  - Batch processing for efficient training.
  - Optimization to fine-tune the model for accurate text generation.
- **Text Generation**: Given an initial input, the model generates contextually appropriate text, demonstrating its ability to understand and predict word sequences.

## Installation & Dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- Keras
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Pandas

## Usage:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the dependencies.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to train and generate text using the LSTM model.

## Results:
The model generates text sequences that are coherent and contextually relevant based on the trained dataset. This can be used for a variety of applications in natural language processing (NLP).

## Future Improvements:
- Explore different architectures or hyperparameters to improve text coherence.
- Implement additional regularization techniques such as dropout to further prevent overfitting.
- Experiment with larger and more diverse text datasets for enhanced performance.
